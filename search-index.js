All models are made of triangles, any quad or polygon faces\nin an OBJ file will be converted to triangles. Note that only polygons that are trivially\nconvertible to triangle fans are supported, arbitrary polygons may not behave as expected.\nThe best solution would be to re-export your mesh using only triangles in your modeling software.","items":[[3,"Mesh","tobj","A mesh made up of triangles loaded from some OBJ file",null,null],[12,"positions","","Flattened 3 component floating point vectors, storing positions of vertices in the mesh",0,null],[12,"normals","","Flattened 3 component floating point vectors, storing normals of vertices in the mesh.
